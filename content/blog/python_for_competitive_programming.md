# My first Cookoff
Last night I was participating in [CodeChef October Cookoff](https://www.codechef.com/COOK111B) for the first time. It was a good experience even though I could solve one [problem](https://www.codechef.com/COOK111B/problems/DOR) completely & two others partially attempted out of total five.

So, there’s a language debate over which should be better for competitive programming. I natively speak in python though I started off with C/C++ family. So, let’s see some comparison over a brute force solution to a problem written in Python (A slow language) and C++ (A fast language).

Python takes > `5.01` seconds (The limit for python on CodeChef is `5.01s`).

Now, Even C++ fails to nail the brute force approach (The limit for C++ on CodeChef is 1.01s).

So, the crux of the story is…

> Concentrate on the correct Logic / Algorithm to solve rather than a certain specific language.

Though this is for the beginners & of course data structure are heavy with Python but for your own sake learn better algorithms each day.
