<p dir="ltr">A cute girl. When i first saw her it was in my class with another girl. It was a small batch of girls out of which she was the most vibrant &amp; visible person. When she walked with her benchmate Monika it was easily visible. She answered in the class, interacted with AK Singh &amp; talked with her friends.<br> She sat on second bench of second row. The place apt for being ahead in the class without being the flag bearer.<br> She was not very very attractive in looks but decent enough to be noticed. Her simplicity &amp; decency was the most attractive part of her. There was another girl sitting on the first bench, Abhilasha. She smiled at me when I spoke in class. Raizada used to tease me for that. Once I tried to talk to her in class but could not make up.</p> <p dir="ltr">This girl has been hard to deal with now. After 5 years she came back to thane after completing engineering. I tried to contact her on Facebook,&nbsp; whatsapp &amp; over phone but all in vain. A long time ago she told me that her best friend has died and she can't chat because she is still remembering her. So sad.<br> Next time she said that she is too busy worrying up for her boyfriend who is having lung cancer. I said, "Oh gheez, all sorrows in the world look for her to be bethown upon". <br> Why can't she say I don't wanna talk. Maybe she is like me. I also never say flat no to someone. I always try to keep them under the bush.<br> Let it be. Her choice. But her story seems utter bullshit. If anyhow true let her cry over her things for god sake. How much can one push you out of pity?<br><br></p> <p dir="ltr">Sent from my Sony Xperia&#8482; smartphone</p>
