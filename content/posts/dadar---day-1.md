Well, it's been quite some time since I studied like Rajdhani express. Actually, whenever I start catching up speed weekend comes up. And during weekends we have classes for straight eight hours.A girl at classes is quite bothering. The whole Dadar concept thing is very annoying. The topics being covered up are too much for a technical student.  

I have been exploring several youtube filmmakers. I have an idea about genres being covered up there. They are very good at it. But an Indian travel show or show like discovery channel has not come up yet. Maybe I can pump in that. I am looking forward to getting hands-on experience on how such things are made.  

Let's see how it erupts out.
