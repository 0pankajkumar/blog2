<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">Well, it's been quite some time since I studied like Rajdhani express. Actually, whenever I start catching up speed weekend comes up. And during weekends we have classes for straight eight hours.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">A girl at classes is quite bothering. The whole Dadar concept thing is very annoying.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The topics being covered up are too much for a technical student.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I have been exploring several youtube filmmakers. I have an idea about&nbsp;genres being covered up there. They are very good at it. But an Indian travel show or show like discovery channel has not come up yet. Maybe I can pump in that. I am looking forward to getting hands-on experience on how such things are made.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Let's see how it erupts out.</div></div>
