<div dir="ltr"><span class="">10 simple points. <br><br>1. <b>READ</b> books from any genre (fiction or nonfiction), newspapers and print media daily for at least 20 minutes. <br><br>2. <b>Sleep</b> early, for an optimum duration and wake early. <br><br>3. <b>Run, </b>work out and stay fit. <br><br>4. <b>Take a long break </b>from social networking sites, instead, <b>socialize </b>in person. It even enhances social skills. <br><br>5. <b>Engage </b>in   a productive hobby like learning a new thing or a hack. It will always   prove helpful no matter how funny or lame or complex it would appear.   (For e.g. cooking!)<br><br>6. <b>Work </b>on your weaknesses. Overcome   your fears. There&#39;s always room for improvement. For e.g. join a public   speaking course if you have stage fright. <br><br>7. <b>Interact </b>more with people who inspire, whom you think you can learn a great deal from, find out what makes them special. <br><br>8. <b>Learn </b>from your mistakes, in fact, be one step ahead and learn from other people&#39;s mistakes. <br><br>9. <b>Avoid </b>judging a person or situation by face value. Stop pointing out flaws or criticising just because it is easy to do. <br><br>10. <b>Think</b> with your own mind. It&#39;s not always wise to follow the crowd mentality.<br><br>Good luck !</span></div>
