 10 simple points.   
  
1. **READ** books from any genre (fiction or nonfiction), newspapers and print media daily for at least 20 minutes.   
  
2. **Sleep** early, for an optimum duration and wake early.   
  
3. **Run,** work out and stay fit.   
  
4. **Take a long break** from social networking sites, instead, **socialize** in person. It even enhances social skills.   
  
5. **Engage** in a productive hobby like learning a new thing or a hack. It will always prove helpful no matter how funny or lame or complex it would appear. (For e.g. cooking!)  
  
6. **Work** on your weaknesses. Overcome your fears. There's always room for improvement. For e.g. join a public speaking course if you have stage fright.   
  
7. **Interact** more with people who inspire, whom you think you can learn a great deal from, find out what makes them special.   
  
8. **Learn** from your mistakes, in fact, be one step ahead and learn from other people's mistakes.   
  
9. **Avoid** judging a person or situation by face value. Stop pointing out flaws or criticising just because it is easy to do.   
  
10. **Think** with your own mind. It's not always wise to follow the crowd mentality.  
  
Good luck !
