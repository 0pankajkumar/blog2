Dilemma.  
Don't know which way to go.  
Do [m.tech](http://m.tech) or shoot movies or do job.  
So it's not dilemma, it's tilemma.

If I go for gate I will have to leave job & prepare for it for Complete academic year. Then I will have option of psu's as well. And life at psu will be damn chill. I hope so.  
[M.tech](http://M.tech) from iit or a foreign school will be like living once college life. That will again play as mind opener. It will provide shelter just like Godrej.  
So it boils down to job or [m.tech](http://m.tech). Possibility of a good life after [m.tech](http://m.tech) is unknown to most of my relatives & friends. Lets Search over web.   
Shooting movies. Lets start with this chap which makes me an artist instead if a banker.   
I think both are aspects of one's life & one should experiment with then enough to determine ones destiny. Because you won't know what's there if you don't go & see for yourself.  
It's very good that I have so many options. Lets dip into them one by one. You know we can't multitask. So it's out of question that I will be confused & struct between the two choices. Just do it will work here. Lets get ourselves to hard cruise this week. Most things will be clear by the time.   
Hope for the best & wear your seatbelt. 

Kudos, sayonara & ala hafiz.
