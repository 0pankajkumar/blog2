 Disclaimer: This is flow of my mind & not a well maintained piece of writing.  
  
Since I had applied for gate exam, naturally I had to apply for iits. I applied to top ones only. That too at bombay and madras only. Due to low self esteem after result declaration with AIR 9750 I was sure that no call will come for general category. And it happened like that way. But quite unusually I got a call for MS at iit madras.  
Now those who just exited the blog are the ones who don't apply for such programmes. Thanks to them & the seats start offering themselves to lower rankers.  
  
Now let me give my point of view for MS. Its similar program to mtech for focus on research. Now for folks who decided to pursue masters must never hesitate from research even its a year longer program. Placements would also be considered but you should have that much confidence that when given a chance you will grab a seat rather than relying on college.  
Again, that's my point of view & apologies on conflict.
