Q: A glass of water has an ice cube floating in water. The water level just touches the rim of the glass. Will the water overflow when the ice melts?  
  
The question is pretty straight forward. If ice will melt certainly some water will be added unnecessarily to cause an overflow.  
  
Well , to find it out i did it all with just a glass of water so full that a few more drops will cause it to overflow.  
  
I dropped a cube of ice from my fridge and applied the test of patience to the apparatus.

Something happened. Guess the result before i reveal.

OK , there was no overflow noted. Not at all.

REASON: the ice which was floating on the surface was not so much outside the water. Thats why the melting had no drastic result in the volume.  
Because, the volume of ice was already incorporated inside water.   
  
Thats it !!
