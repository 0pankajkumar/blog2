 You were not selected  
and Kalpana was killed.  
The story is old now. Rejection has taken on me.  
What i conclude is that i am weak in one aspect only.  
Thst is my academics and career goal. I beleived for a long time time that i was not made for mechanical engineering. But, such a great dicipline can't be left like that.  
After all it is my Jaya Bachchan and computer are my Rekha. I think i will get along well with my arranged marriage.   
  
Also, i would make a note here that i will never let anyone control the ropes of my cariot. This has to the first and the last. Such a great dicision will be left to my responsibility only.  
In my case both Jaya and Rekha can sustain together for me. I think my interest areas will fall right in a compromise between the two. In this way i would be able to fulfill my responsibility as well as interests.  
Also, computers are not that mighty in my wishlist. The real world around me coiling around mechanical engineering is also of a great priority in my list.
