<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">You were not selected<br />and Kalpana was killed.<br />The story is old now. Rejection has taken on me.<br />What i conclude is that i am weak in one aspect only.<br />Thst is my academics and career goal. I beleived for a long time time that i was ot made for mechanical engineering. But, such a great dicipline can't be left like that.<br />After all it is my Jaya Bachchan and computer are my Rekha. I think i will get along well with my arranged marriage. <br /><br />Also, i would make a note here that i will never let anyone control the ropes of my cariot. This has to the first and the last. Such a great dicision will be left to my responsibility only.<br />In my case both Jaya and Rekha can sustain together for me. I think my interest areas will fall right in a compromise between the two. In this way i would be able to fulfill my responsibility as well as interests.<br />Also, computers are not that mighty in my wishlist. The real world around me coiling around mechanical engineering is also of a great priority in my list.<br />..<br />also read part2</div>
