 NOTE:  
The below writing is for my personal diary purpose and treating it as a public article might not be suitable. you may find that its written very roughly. It can be for reference for candidates trying for Uhde India Pvt. Ltd  
  
  
Q: tell me about yourself  
A: i am pankaj kumar. my father was in Indian navy and i am 2nd graduating engineer in my clan. i like mechanical engineering because its very much visible in the real world and it answers many day to day questions  
  
Q: why dint u joined Indian navy  
A: because of my little finger  
  
Q: do u have any problem while doing anything with hand  
A: whatever u can do,i can do. its normal, no problem at all  
  
Q: what are your favorite subjects  
A: thermodynamics, thermal. materials science  
  
Q: what is normalizing?  
A: heating above some temperature, i think 723C, (he was confused) holding at that temperature and cooling in air  
Q: is it really 723C?  
A: yes  
  
Q:what is annealing?  
A: only difference, its cooled in furnace itself  
  
Q: what type of grain structure in normalizing?  
A: coarse as compared to annealing as its cooled faster  
  
Q: what about annealing?  
A: finer grain is obtained  
  
Q: what is formula for hoop stress?  
A: its (p*d)/(2*something). [what is that something ,he didn't asked but it was on his face]  
  
Q: formula for bending stress?  
A: sigmaB=M/Z  
  
Q: what is this Z?  
A: shear modulus  
  
Q: whats shear modulus?  
A: i was blank  
  
Q: (he drew a figure of L section in two rotated views and asked) which has maximum shear modulus?  
A: i said i don't know but know that bending will be maximum in one of the figures. (there was a confusion in the figure he drew)  
 i said that Z is dependent on I and I is different for each geometry. (then it suddenly clicked me). Since the geometries are same I and Z will be same. (he agreed)  
  
Q: can we weld aluminum and stainless steel  
A: no idea sir.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
HR interview  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Q: tell me about yourself?  
A: my father was in Indian navy , mother house wife  
  
Q: tell me about extra curricular activities  
A: participated in junkyard wars(described the whole process)  
  
Q: any projects?  
A: told about mechatronics project. " I was involved in the project from beginning till end (she said , u were alone involved in it?) to which i replied that no. But , i conceived the idea and was there from beginning till end.  
  
Q: any conclusion regarding that?  
A: i knew where it failed(told about problem in temperature sensor) and also because of insufficient knowledge in electronics, it failed.  
  
Q: Any other project?  
A: i said final year and told the topic ,"vibration modal analysis of beams"(she was least interested in that)  
  
Q: what do you family and friends think about yourself?  
A: (i was fumbled and searching for words in my head) i said that they think i am studious and can achieve great heights in my life  
  
Q: do u think being studious is helpful?  
A: yes, i said. (but was still searching for reasons with aaah ummmm and all that sounds up) then finally said that then only u can read from literature and grab knowledge as being studious.  
  
Q: what is your greatest achievement?  
A: i liked computer engg. in 12th as i was prone to computer at my home. After joining mechanical i saw much. items like lathe machine and all that. So, i was attracted towards it. now i am proud to be a mechanical engineer.  
  
Q: OK, thank u!  
{we shook hands and i departed}  
  
my mouth was dry after speaking for aso long  
  
i decided that my past performance is not that lucrative or good.  
Also feel like some of my work is still remaining(i had decided to learn it all of mechanical engineering and become a deserving candidate)  
i will have to pull up socks and achieve this great feat  
  
improvement areas:  
technical knowledge (S.O.M , production , material science)  
interview (prepare thoroughly for HR interview, u failed there!)  
Don't forget the aptitude test. keep improving as you had just crossed the boundary in Uhde India's interview
