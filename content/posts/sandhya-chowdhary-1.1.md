<p dir="ltr">She was standing beside deepika. Deepika was offended by an arrogant boy of the class. I don't know the exact sequence of events but still it was a major incident. We all 9th graders were full of raw blood gleaming into our adolescents. <br> All the three were standing on stairs. Discussing something vigorously. Deepika had her head down as if wanted to cry. Maybe she had already shed some tears &amp; wanted some more to be. Sandhya was arguing with that kanpur spoilt brat much elder than all of us in class. <br> She was like a feminist fighting for wrong against women. But this time the culprit was her own friend. Her benchmate, her walk-to-home friend. Much like her best of friends.<br> "Rahul, whatever you have done is shameful. How can you do that to a girl?", said Sandhya.<br> "See, the way in which she reacted was very rude to me. I have done nothing. Don't blame me.", Rahul reacted.<br> "Deepika can complain this to your father as well", Sandhya reverted back.<br> Rahul wanted to escape this. He had an interesting nature of assaulting people &amp; then pleading before them. <br> "You can tell anybody",&#160; replied Rahul hiding his fear. "But,Let us sort this out here itself".<br> I was climbing the stairs &amp; watching the threesome talking &amp; observed this broad shouldered, heroic lady more confident than other girls. She caught my attention &amp; established herself as another prominent person of class. <br> She came few days ago in our class as her father was transferred to nearby Air force Base. I still remember that day when I first saw her.<br><br></p> <p dir="ltr">Sent from my Sony Xperia&#8482; smartphone</p>
