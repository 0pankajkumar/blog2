 She was standing beside deepika. Deepika was offended by an arrogant boy of the class. I don't know the exact sequence of events but still it was a major incident. We all 9th graders were full of raw blood gleaming into our adolescents.   
 All the three were standing on stairs. Discussing something vigorously. Deepika had her head down as if wanted to cry. Maybe she had already shed some tears & wanted some more to be. Sandhya was arguing with that kanpur spoilt brat much elder than all of us in class.   
 She was like a feminist fighting for wrong against women. But this time the culprit was her own friend. Her benchmate, her walk-to-home friend. Much like her best of friends.  
 "Rahul, whatever you have done is shameful. How can you do that to a girl?", said Sandhya.  
 "See, the way in which she reacted was very rude to me. I have done nothing. Don't blame me.", Rahul reacted.  
 "Deepika can complain this to your father as well", Sandhya reverted back.  
 Rahul wanted to escape this. He had an interesting nature of assaulting people & then pleading before them.   
 "You can tell anybody", replied Rahul hiding his fear. "But,Let us sort this out here itself".  
 I was climbing the stairs & watching the threesome talking & observed this broad shouldered, heroic lady more confident than other girls. She caught my attention & established herself as another prominent person of class.   
 She came few days ago in our class as her father was transferred to nearby Air force Base. I still remember that day when I first saw her.
