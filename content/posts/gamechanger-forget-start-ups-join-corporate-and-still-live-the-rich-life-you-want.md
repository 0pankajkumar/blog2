The book was all about how one should invest his salary for the retirement without compromising on the present needs.
First thing is always to set a goal and save for it from each month's salary. This way you will have some money left after savings which can be spent lavishly on mundane things. In the end you will have the goal fulfilled as well.

So, it wasn't anything about not to start a company & live in corporate ladder. It was just to make the best of the current job in hand.

It is still there on [Kindle](https://www.amazon.in/Gamechanger-Forget-Start-ups-Corporate-Still-ebook/dp/B072MC4931?ie=UTF8&ref_=ku_mi_rw_edp)
