 Disclaimer: This is flow of my mind & not a well maintained piece of writing.  
  
  
The bus was 2+2 semi sleeper of volvo brand but old one. It was comfortable. But soon the A/C started chilling us as we approached lonavala. I went down at lonavala for a pee & started sneezing and shivering, sure signs of hitting cold. I quickly ran inside the bus and covered myself in the warmth of blanket.  
At night I slept well but could not twist and turn much which was obvious in semi sleeper buses.  
  
In the morning we halted somewhere in Karnataka. I had a good motion & ate upma for breakfast which I remembered till evening. I think the oil in it was not good or suiting me.  
  
A man sat beside me in the middle of trip who was generous. Anybody whom I told about my destination was suggesting me board a train only for such long journeys. To my disposal there were limited choices as I could'nt get railway ticket due to holiday season rush. Airplane was out of option as a one way fare would be double of my total expenses of the trip.  
We were thinking that bus would halt somewhere for lunch. But as it was already late driver decided to head straight away to Banglore. My seat mate offered me laddus which I could not refuse. Sweet and innocent laddus were asking for it. Then I offered him grapes which he took just one & upon offering again told about lunch halt he was waiting for which never came.  
  
We reached Banglore around 03:00 PM. I straight away went to Seabird's office to ask for my onward journey to Chennai. New bus ticket was given. I now had one last thing to do. Satisfy my stomach for lunch compensation. That upma of morning was still making me uneasy. I decided to switch to natural food. I found one fruit stall & had a plate. Still I needed something. I bought a chikki & three big south Indian bananas along with water bottle and boarded the bus. I was given last seat in the bus which I thought would be more jerky. But it was good.  
  
After the bus left Banglore it started raining. I wondered what will I do if it continued till I reach Chennai. It stopped.  
The bus halted somewhere in Tamil nadu for dinner. I went down very late as I was last seated in the bus. I straightaway went to pee. When I came back I was in a dilemma whether I should eat oily or stick to natural.  
I went to a hotel with Rs 100 in my pocket. The dinner menu was overshooting my pocket. I decided to order ghee parota and double omlette. Till I was there in that hotel went numerous times outside to check whether bus was leaving or not. I ate in hurry and came out to find the bus still empty with the driver nowhere to be seen. Now I wanted coconut water. Coming to south India in summer and not drinking coconut water?  
But it was available with malai. "Now how to eat malai", I thought.  
I drank it whole and returned back the husk container for malai. To my surprise he cut that into two & scrapped malai with a tool. Professional coconut man. While I was enjoying the malai bus started honking. I ran in with malai in my hand. That was a tasty dinner to remember.  
  
Upon my enquiry I came to know that bus will reach Chennai at midnight. Now the qiestion is,"Will IIT allow me to board the hostel this late at night?" I called hostel warden's office. Nobody picked up. I thought for a while to book a stay outside. Then something came in my mind & I dialed security desk at IIT. A man picked up. He understood me completely & assured that room will be given in his Tamilian tone Hindi.  
  
I was glad. I booked a Uber cab after unboarding the bus. The cab was Tata Indica with a 19 year old boy as driver. I was surprised but estimated that he might have just crossed the licence age. He could not understand Hindi & was asking which way I wanted to go. I made it clear that I wanted to go at main gate which he could'nt understand. He said he would follow the maps feed which I gave on Uber app. He stopped somewhere in the middle & asked me "Saptya". I knew that he meant food but why was he asking for in the middle of a trip. Then he cleared the air with two words," Tiffin parcel". He went down & came with dosa parcel.   
We staright away headed to IIT. Security people were nice & kind and instructed me to go at CCW ( warden's office). He rode for sometime & was amazed by the enormous campus build inside a jungle. Upon several enquiries we came to CCW building.  
  
The campus was dense in vegetation with several departmental buildings inbetween. It was like visting the mecca of enginnering. You name it & that department building was there. Some roads were as "16 cross road", "Delhi avenue" etc. It was new for me.  
  
At CCW I was directed towards Tamiraparani hostel. I remember the name now. I was alloted a room on sharing basis with a phd applicant of Biotechnology branch. I settled down for the night on the cot & he on the mat kept on floor. He was comfortable with it. The room was smoky due to mosquito coil he burnt although I could not find any. I lied down & went into deep remembrance of my thoughts. I thought about my daily happenings in Mumbai. I was surprised to find myself in this new place when I woke up. I came back to senses within a few seconds. I wondered how people coped up with jet lag.
