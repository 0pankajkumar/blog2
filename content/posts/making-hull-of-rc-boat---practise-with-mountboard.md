 Making a RC boat out of scratch.  
Trying to enter the world of engineers who make things happen by sheer will.  
This all has begun with formation of my team for event combat nautica @ [Techfest](http://www.techfest.org/) .  
  
We have been thinking a lot and reding a bit on the best possible model which we need, For that we had to fix certain requirements for our boat.  

* The water machine should in no way sink as it will be loaded with costly electronics and our hard work.
* It should be fast, fast enough to be in the competition.
* The investment should be optimum ( a compromise between performance and cost).

We even came up with our own plans and started making a cardboard model of the same.

We were practising the making as anything after this will be costilier and failure is not expected.

We have learnt our lessions that its not childs playto make it.  
Hope that we would do well even with wood in Hand.
