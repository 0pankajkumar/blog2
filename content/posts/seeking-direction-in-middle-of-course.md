<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Well, it's some time since I typed anything. Now that I have come up here goes the story.<br />My mind has been distracting away since some time. I feel so. I am not milking my time these days to its&nbsp;full extent.<br /><br />Maybe it's time to start swotting like Muhammad Ali.<br />Working out to find a way myself. Let's see.<br /><br />I can't even type out a paragraph on something how will I be able to speak for a long time.<br />I have a plan to be the&nbsp;best speaker out there when I speak. They say you have to dance actually if you are preparing for a show at a&nbsp;stage as it can't be done by merely watching beautiful videos &amp; reading motivational stories.<br /><br />So my plan is to solve may numericals related to topics.<br />The only problem is I am too slow. I won't be able to complete all.<br />No problem. I will schedule deadline for revision of classes notes &amp; topics as listed in syllabus.<br />Clubbing it with timed tests will complete something for me if not all.<br /><br />Only thing is I don't want to give GATE exam again &amp; again just to realize my errors &amp; correct them.<br />I will learn &amp; copy from others to move forward. That's how its done. I can't wait for my mistakes to pop up &amp; get corrected. Although it can't be avoided throughout, I will still try my best.<br /><br />After all, my goal is to get <i>below 500 rank</i>. (let us see how)<br />My ultimate vision being <i>to make myself a sound mechanical engineer who can solve problems given at live scenarios</i>.<br /><br /><br /></div>
