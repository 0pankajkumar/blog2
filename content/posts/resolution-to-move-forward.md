<p dir="ltr">It was a long day. Fully resting. Nothing to do much except entertainment &amp; rest of course.</p>  <p dir="ltr">I was thinking of doing a particular thong to be awake through my journey at godrej. It will mean much sense if i crave for something &amp; go after it instead of feeding whatever is thrown over to me.</p>  <p dir="ltr">Hope my resolution will last longer as they suck out all my energy to think during weekdays.</p>  <p dir="ltr">Regards </p>
