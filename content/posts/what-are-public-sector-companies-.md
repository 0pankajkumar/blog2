 While pondering over various companies i came across some companies which were specially tagged. Although i knew the tags but still wasn't sure. I found out about them. ###

### Companies which are owned partially or completely by government are called public sector companies.

Primary : Owned & funded by government, completely eg.[![](http://recruiters.freshersvalue.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/01-indian-navy-logo.jpg)](http://recruiters.freshersvalue.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/01-indian-navy-logo.jpg)[![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/MSPD.jpg)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/MSPD.jpg)
