# [Solved] Fedora 32 touchpad not working

Last week I installed Fedora to get the other side of distos. From the beginning I have been with the Debain family. Tried Ubuntu, Debian & linux Mint.

Now Fedora 32 installed nicely on my laptop. 
```
Specification:
Dell Latitude 3380
Memory : 8 GB
Processor : Intel Core i3-6006U CPU @ 2.00 GHz
Disk: 500 GB
Type: 64 bits 
```

### The problem
The touchpad didn't work after installing Fedora 32. It worked in the past with Windows 10 & Ubuntu 18.04.
I searched online but couldn't find anything helpful.

### The solution
Go to setting & enable it :)

Navigate to `Settings > Mouse & Touchpad > Touchpad`
Just enable the `Touchpad` option as shown below.
I don't why this is disabled by deafult. But I am sure this is a design feature & not a bug.
Enjoy !
