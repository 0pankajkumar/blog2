 Since this is one of my first blog, i might end up being into confession type of writing.

OK! i wanted every thing good in my since i am awake. Of course every one of us do exactly this.  
I always wanted freedom ( inspired from history lessons of freedom). When i joined engineering I was not even aware about what I have just choose for myself. I was fully guided into the scenario by my loved ones.  
  
But, i learned one thing. Engineering is not just another class of you 12 year school curriculum. In school we never look forward to our next year as we already know that it will be incremented by 1. Its like a fixed commitment which you have to sign in stamp papers promising that you will adhere to the 4-year curriculum.

When I was in my class 12th (last year of schooling at higher secondary school) most of my classmates were preparing for entrance exams with the majority coaching for IIT-JEE the grand brand. I was not sure whether to go for that shot or not (also it was very costly affair). So i switched to normal curriculum of schooling.  
  
At the end of class 12th I was in utter danger. It seem like the world is flat and i have reached its end. To survive i have to just over to the next flat surface. I dont remember well but I fared very badly in entrance exams (i don't feel guilty as i never prepared for it).  
  
As many colleges were opened up in my domicile state i got an admission through state level CET under some quota which I am really thankful to.  
From there I began the longer than long engineering curriculum.  
I can express exactly but its like rebirth for me and I may simply call it ,  
  
BARE BEGINNING !
