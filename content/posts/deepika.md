## Deepika not padukone
She is an ex-collegue. We used to sit in a long bay with all the team of Talent aquisition. 

Here is my first impression of her. I hardly noiticed her in the sea of people sitting in the bay. I first noticed her when she went to europe trip. That was one thing which she did from the rest to catch my attention. She travelled with one of her friend & posted a lot of facinating pictures on instagram. It was mesmerizing to watch the europe in the photos. That's it. She returned back & went with the sea of people in the bay.

Our team used to have lunch together in the cafeteria. It was a little odd in the beginning to sit with a all girl gang for me. But I mixed up slowly. She used to have diet food which included exotic looking salad & other healthy kind of stuff. That caught my attention.

Then, during one of those year ending weeks, I think, a lot of collegues were on holidays. So, there were a few of the pack in the bay those days. We discussed physics & technology related stuff & interacted a lot. There I came to know that she yearns to know more about stuff. Some may call her beauty with brains.

After some time the nation went into corona lockdown due to chinese flu in March 2020. She was supposed to leave the comapany & join BrowserStack. We gave her farewell over video call. Actually we made a lot of videos during each of the occasions before lockdown & continued to make a few more while at home. We recorded & sent to the person editing. For one of those I recorded a video of me eating popcorn with a dramatic face. There she noticed me. And we started interacting over whatsapp.

She liked that video & one of her friend agreed. After that we discussed a lot of philosophy over a span of months. She helped me to get in touch with Bharat & guided me in taking the next job & preparation. During all of those interactions I found a person into which I could confide into. This helped me in social interaction as we were literally locked up at homes.

### The confusion
We were & are good friends till now. But I don't know where is this coming into my head. I am liking being in the friend zone. But, sometimes she takes a lot of time replying back over whatsapp. This sets me furious at times. But why should I be? Who are we? Just friends I suppose. Then why is it not going like that? That's the confusion.

Last time I went head on to express it with Shashin on a similar scenerio. I told her over facebook messages & it failed miserably. She stopped replying back. Dead silence!
I deleted her number in anger & now I have just her facebook contact. I fear a similar scenerio will happen with Deepika as well. So being mum for now & going by the wind.

Peace.
