<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr">So.........................................................................................................................................<br />  It was an amazing and thrilling vacation. I wasn't sure of how i would spend my vacations. My exams went on less painful then the previous ones.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Also they were more engaging and lively. I felt the pulse of each exam much better this seventh semester. Actually one more semester awaits me but this one was to be the last one in which i could prove my metal. </div><div dir="ltr"><br />  After placements my boat has started sailing in other direction than actually planned at the beginning. I wished to prepare for GATE exam and reach PSU's at least &amp; IIT's at most. But it was really hard to resolve for a rigorous and marathon like entrance exam. </div><div dir="ltr"><br />  It was difficult for me this vacation. But i wish to prepare for it in the near future. At least topics related to manufacturing will be my destination.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">So what i did this December vacation?</div><div dir="ltr"></div><div dir="ltr"></div><div dir="ltr"></div><div dir="ltr"></div><div dir="ltr"></div><div dir="ltr"></div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr"><br />  In previous attempts , during semester exams i planned a long list of things to be done in the vacations. This was right from class 10th vacations. But i could never actually achieve anything.&nbsp;</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">You know, "Its harder done then said".</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>This vacation i went on a trekking trip to a hill top at sayhadri range.</li><li>I went on to build a RC boat for<a href="http://www.techfest.org/" target="_blank"> techfest </a>competition.</li><li>Watched some most desirable &amp; handpicked movies.</li><li>Drew a sketch of my childhood time.</li><li>Met some of my childhood friends.</li><li>Started <a href="https://indianmechengineer.blogspot.com/">blogging.</a></li><li>Went active on Twitter. <a href="https://twitter.com/mechgineer" target="_blank">@mechgineer</a> Now everything related to me from my mind will  reflect back here on&nbsp; web for my reference. In short i have started  writing diary.</li></ol><div dir="ltr"><br />  <br />  </div><div dir="ltr">Things which i missed like GATE preparation will surely feel like a gap but still, i have made a great time this vacation .<br />  </div></div>
