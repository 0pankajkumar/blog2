 So.........................................................................................................................................  
 It was an amazing and thrilling vacation. I wasn't sure of how i would spend my vacations. My exams went on less painful then the previous ones.  
Also they were more engaging and lively. I felt the pulse of each exam much better this seventh semester. Actually one more semester awaits me but this one was to be the last one in which i could prove my metal.   
 After placements my boat has started sailing in other direction than actually planned at the beginning. I wished to prepare for GATE exam and reach PSU's at least & IIT's at most. But it was really hard to resolve for a rigorous and marathon like entrance exam.   
 It was difficult for me this vacation. But i wish to prepare for it in the near future. At least topics related to manufacturing will be my destination.  
  
So what i did this December vacation?  
  
 In previous attempts , during semester exams i planned a long list of things to be done in the vacations. This was right from class 10th vacations. But i could never actually achieve anything.   
You know, "Its harder done then said".  

1. This vacation i went on a trekking trip to a hill top at sayhadri range.
2. I went on to build a RC boat for [techfest](http://www.techfest.org/) competition.
3. Watched some most desirable & handpicked movies.
4. Drew a sketch of my childhood time.
5. Met some of my childhood friends.
6. Started [blogging.](https://indianmechengineer.blogspot.com/)
7. Went active on Twitter. [@mechgineer](https://twitter.com/mechgineer) Now everything related to me from my mind will reflect back here on web for my reference. In short i have started writing diary.

  
   
 Things which i missed like GATE preparation will surely feel like a gap but still, i have made a great time this vacation .
