 Going on as per plan.  
 Reason for feeling bad:  
 I am still following the crowd. It's like crying over split milk.  
 All was part of your own plan man.  
 This is how subconscious work.

 Just make sure that before leaving you go to all possible branches because some more money will not hurt.  
 Wait. This is type of risk taking business we were talking about. No, it doesn't had to involve risk always. But the way in which I am moving should not have multiple goals.   
 People may meet on the way & suggest their best. But its you who are travelling. So beware.
