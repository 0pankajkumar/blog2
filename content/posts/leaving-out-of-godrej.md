<p dir="ltr">Going on as per plan.<br> Reason for feeling bad:<br> I am still following the crowd. It's like crying over split milk.<br> All was part of your own plan man.<br> This is how subconscious work.</p> <p dir="ltr">Just make sure that before leaving you go to all possible branches because some more money will not hurt.<br> Wait. This is type of risk taking business we were talking about. No, it doesn't had to involve risk always. But the way in which I am moving should not have multiple goals. <br> People may meet on the way &amp; suggest their best. But its you who are travelling. So beware.<br></p> <p dir="ltr">Sent from my Sony Xperia&#8482; smartphone</p>
