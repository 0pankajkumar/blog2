<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">Good Morning !</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I have been living in the flow for past one day. It's like studying, breaking up for something else &amp; again going back. The whole <i>picture of gate exam gets clear</i> when you solve question papers as the&nbsp;whole syllabus gets covered.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">But still, I am not solving enough numericals to attain the best feel in particular topics &amp; subject.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">I think one should start feeling very comfortable in topics &amp; subjects. At that point of time only, one can say that half his/her preparations are done. Rest half can be covered by solving problems &amp; revising everything till the exam day.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Hope I put in enough justice to the preparation.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div></div>
