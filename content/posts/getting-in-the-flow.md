 Good Morning !  

I have been living in the flow for past one day. It's like studying, breaking up for something else & again going back. The whole *picture of gate exam gets clear* when you solve question papers as the whole syllabus gets covered.  

But still, I am not solving enough numericals to attain the best feel in particular topics & subject.I think one should start feeling very comfortable in topics & subjects. At that point of time only, one can say that half his/her preparations are done. Rest half can be covered by solving problems & revising everything till the exam day.   
Hope I put in enough justice to the preparation.
