 It's been well thought off. Or you can say dreamt off.What I will be doing in near future is very uncertain & only god can know. But how I want to see myself few years down the line is as below.  

Having a successful *career as mechanical engineer* will compliment my work for last five years & will be a good backup if future ventures fail anyhow. I know this is the wrong way to proceed. But let's see. I have been doing great, experimenting myself. And, in any experiment one has to be cautious to wear protective equipments (just in case). The moment it appears to be a burden then parachutes will be deployed to free me from all the burden.  

Along with a good engineer, *preferably in designing new things* I feel from the bottom of my heart that I have a very creative mind that just can't figure out to settle in 9-5 chore. Maybe I am a bit lazy too.  

I want to *make some great looking movie clips with the best of themes* only limited by my imagination in my spare time. Maybe I can pursue this as full-time someday but that's part of my venture.  

Apart from the above, I have many other thoughts related to ventures which I will be doing.  

One of them is to form a media company like Reuters.
