<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">It's been well thought off. Or you can say dreamt off.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">What I will be doing in near future is very uncertain &amp; only god can know. But how I want to see myself few&nbsp;years down the line is as below.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Having a successful <i>career as mechanical engineer</i> will compliment my work for last five years &amp; will be a good backup if future ventures fail anyhow. I know this is the wrong way to proceed. But let's see. I have been doing great, experimenting myself. And, in any experiment one has to be cautious to wear protective equipments&nbsp;(just in case). The moment it appears to be a burden then parachutes will be deployed to free me from all the burden.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Along with a good engineer, <i>preferably in designing new things</i>&nbsp;I feel from the bottom of my heart that I have a very creative mind that just can't figure out to settle in 9-5 chore. Maybe I am a bit lazy too.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I want to <i>make some great looking movie clips with the best of themes</i> only limited by my imagination in my spare time. Maybe I can pursue this as full-time someday but that's part of my venture.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Apart from the above, I have many other thoughts related to ventures which I will be doing.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">One of them is to form a media company like Reuters.<br /><br /><br /><br />Signing off...</div></div>
