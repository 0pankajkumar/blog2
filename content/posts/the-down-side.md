Maybe i had misused my winter break.</div><div dir="ltr">No that can't be the case. Maybe i messed up with my Sunday. </div><div dir="ltr"></div><div dir="ltr"></div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr"><br />  With almost no plan for it and aspirations unsatisfied, i should direct my energy more towards them.</div><div dir="ltr"><br />  Why to fall ever and the enjoy the joy of gliding up. In that way i would be struck at the same position throughout. Its like going from point A to B&nbsp; and then back to A. Overall, no gain in displacement.</div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr">Rise , Rise above your normal self and reach newer heights. Don't hold or stay there , you might tend to descend. </div><div dir="ltr"></div><div dir="ltr"><br /></div><div dir="ltr"><br />  Start rising again, may the heavens show you the path . </div></div>
