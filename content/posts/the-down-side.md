 The direction of waves have reversed. I don't know why but i feel guilty. Maybe i had misused my winter break.No that can't be the case. Maybe i messed up with my Sunday.   
  
 With almost no plan for it and aspirations unsatisfied, i should direct my energy more towards them.  
 Why to fall ever and the enjoy the joy of gliding up. In that way i would be struck at the same position throughout. Its like going from point A to B and then back to A. Overall, no gain in displacement.  
  
Rise , Rise above your normal self and reach newer heights. Don't hold or stay there , you might tend to descend.   
  
 Start rising again, may the heavens show you the path .
