 Disclaimer: This is flow of my mind & not a well maintained piece of writing.  
  
  
At office I told everything exactly. Two days interview & test and I will be absent. I did this because we had an understanding & agreement before I was rolled in that I will be leaving as soon as I get masters opprtunity.  
  
Anyways, the milkman milking cow is curious about how much time she will not give milk & how often. So he asked likewise and got his answers which seemed satisfactory.  
  
  
So, Saturday evening I rushed from office at 05:15 PM sharp. Harish sir wished me luck. I wonder which way he wanted although his wishes were true.  
I got a fast train from Dadar to Thane. In the way I was calculating time I would be spending at home to catch a bus to Chennai at 09:00 PM.  
Luckily I got a bus very soon to home from Thane station.  
I reached home & felt like I was returning after just a day at office. (I moved to kanjurmarg few days ago)  
Relaxed a little & asked my mother how she was doing.(She was ill since a few days) I was planning to take the same shirt and trousers which I came with from office. My mother and sister were insisting to wear a better one on that day. After a lot of persuation I gave up & a white shirt was water sprayed and pressed to be packed.  
  
I took a bath for last time since for 2-3 days I won't be able to.  
Sabzi was to come from outside today & I waited for it. When it came & I was finished eating it was already around 7:55 PM. It takes 30 minutes each from bus & then by local train to reach bus stop at vashi, that too if I got them as soon I approached their stops. I was therefore advised to catch a rickshaw instead and rush to station. My younger brother came to drop me as far as I could get a rickshaw. I got it within 100 meters & boarded it. But my luck would not be that good at each mode of transport. A sense of urgency flowing in me knew that if bus maintained exact time of departure I would miss it for sure. I quickly took my mobile out & installed uber, booked it at a nearby point and waited anxiously to board it.  
The taxi started fast but the driver hinted that it will be late. I phoned the bus & enquired about its location. It was little bit far away & I knew that it will hit traffic jams on its way. This buyed me some time. The drive also milked the situation for a quick refuelling. This made me a little nervous as I was on moving cut to cut with time. I ensured myself that I will call the driver to wait for five more minutes in case I missed it.   
  
The driver was an interseting person to talk to. Upon asking he told that taxi business was not going that good even though he had ola & uber driver membership due to boom in number of cars available.  
He recited a couple of accident scenerios he had in his career. This kept me occupied from overthinking.  
  
I reached vashi plaza junction & started rushing to bus stop. I was confused about the exact location as I boarded a bus to Banglore 100 meters farther than the driver's instructed place. I paused my thinking cycle a little & relied upon the words of driver. Upon waiting I met with another co-passenger to my relief.  
The bus got delayed by massive 55 minutes & I waited for it for around 25 minutes. That saved my trip. The bus was boarded soon.
