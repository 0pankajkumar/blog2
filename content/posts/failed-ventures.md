 The saga of failing ventures. A venture is something which you do outside your comfort zone.  
 I have just started diving outside my well. This must be the tip of iceberg.   
 Dated a girl. Although not successfully, but satisfactorily. The good thing is it happened outside my mind. Thanks to her for cooperation. But I must say that, Erica Albright is a bitch. It felt that way in the end.  
 I have grown more passionate. Although I have observed it only in songs. Iam sure that it reflects in other aspects. Afterall we are playing with our body fluids.   
 Hormones need to be handled as per their flow. This will be according to flow.  
 I will soon go for new ventures & improve older ones. New one of studying SOM.  
 The good thing I have learned is expressing myself. Before this I could not talk to anyone for more than sometime. Now I have done this for hours. I felt myself exhausted at times knowing that my brain have reached end of its juices. That felt like an achievement.   
 May god give me many such more opportunities.   
 Maza aa gaya!
