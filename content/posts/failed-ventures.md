<p dir="ltr">The saga of failing ventures. A venture is something which you do outside your comfort zone.<br> I have just started diving outside my well. This must be the tip of iceberg. <br> Dated a girl. Although not successfully, but satisfactorily. The good thing is it happened outside my mind. Thanks to her for cooperation. But I must say that, Erica Albright is a bitch. It felt that way in the end.<br> I have grown more passionate. Although I have observed it only in songs. Iam sure that it reflects in other aspects. Afterall we are playing with our body fluids. <br> Hormones need to be handled as per their flow. This will be according to flow.<br> I will soon go for new ventures &amp; improve older ones. New one of studying SOM.<br> The good thing I have learned is expressing myself. Before this I could not talk to anyone for more than sometime. Now I have done this for hours. I felt myself exhausted at times knowing that my brain have reached end of its juices. That felt like an achievement. <br> May god give me many such more opportunities. <br> Maza aa gaya!<br><br></p> <p dir="ltr">Sent from my Sony Xperia&#8482; smartphone</p>
