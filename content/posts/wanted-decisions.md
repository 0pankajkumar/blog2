<p dir="ltr">I have been experiencing a set back during these days at Godrej. It's like doing something you don't like much &amp; that too for such a long time. 6 days a week, 8-9 hours ie 48-54 hours per week. After some calculations I come out to be having less than 22 hours per week ; cutting travelling, eating &amp; other shit.<br> (maybe I'll be late to office today, late enough to be considered as half day)<br> So in such a less time if I consider that 10-12 hours of them I enjoy saying that its sunday then iam left with 10-12 hours which should be put to productive use. Since it will be scattered enough throughout the week that I won't be able to account for them, there is need for written works. It's just like they do in chess, stop start the timer whenever u finish your turn.<br> Lets see. What I wish to achieve has to be written down first.</p> <p dir="ltr">Sent from my Sony Xperia&#8482; smartphone</p>
